                Hi, my name is Ethan Wheeler. I am currently in my 3rd year of studying Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University. 
                I am passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I am excited to share my journey with you. When I'm not coding, 
                you can find me on the hockey rink, enjoying a round of golf, or hitting the gym to stay active and healthy.
            </p>
